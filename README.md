# Mathematical Modeling - Final Project

As a final project in my Mathematical Modeling class, I've build a C++ program to simulate how long it will take for a solution to be fully mixed into another solution given a set tempeture and set viscosity (added cornstarch). <br /> <br />

Base simulation - tracked the time it would take the ink to reach the bottom of the cube with a set of direction specific transfer rates. <br /> <br />

Navier-Stokes Inspired simulation - tracked the same thing with a few additional backward direction specific transfer rates.

Results <br />
<ul>
  <li>The base simulation was the only simulation that was able to work given the simple sequencial approach and with unrealible data, the simulation was only adjusted to fit the ink to plain water.
</ul>
