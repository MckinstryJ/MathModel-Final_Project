# Mathematical Modeling - Final Project

As a final project in my Mathematical Modeling class, I've build a C++ program to simulate how long it will take for a solution to be fully mixed into another solution given a set tempeture. <br /> <br />

Version 1.0 tracked the time it would take if every downward (to side) direction had an equal distribution. This is not very realistic, but it sets the base for version 2.0. <br /><br />

Version 2.0 (after actual data has been gathered) tracked the time it would take for the 2nd solution to be fully mixed into the 1st while following a behavior that closely matches version 1.0 ...and... that matched the data gathered. <br /><br />

Version 3.0 (final version) does the same thing as version 1.0 and 2.0 but this time it's behavior matched what I could find through research. Dropping a drop of ink into water does a good job summarizing the behavior of verison 3.0. <br />(HERES A LINK TO SOMEONE DOING IT - https://youtu.be/Peg1yaB2bsk) <br /><br />
